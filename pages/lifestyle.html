  <h1> Popular musicians of Fender players</h1>
   <h3>Eric Clapton</h3> <p>(born 1945), a Grammy-award-winning guitarist who originally played Gibson guitars but has been a Stratocaster enthusiast since 1967. Clapton bought his first Stratocaster that year while a member of Cream, Brownie, which was later used on "Layla". Blackie, a composite of three different guitars, went into service in 1970 and was regularly played until its retirement in 1985. It was sold at charity auction for $959,500 in 2004. In 1988, Fender introduced the Eric Clapton Stratocaster, the first model in their Signature series. Clapton has been a long-standing client of the Fender Custom Shop.</p>

<h3>Jimi Hendrix</h3>

  <p>Jimi Hendrix (1942–1970), known for developing blues in a modern context, Hendrix' main stage guitar through most of his short career was a Fender Stratocaster.In 1990, the white Stratocaster used by Hendrix at the 1969 Woodstock Festival sold in a Sotheby's auction for $270,000, a record price at the time. Although Hendrix played left-handed, he did not normally use a custom left-handed Stratocaster. Instead, he is noted for playing a conventional right-handed Stratocaster flipped upside down because he preferred to use the controls in that position. Like Buddy Holly, Hendrix was responsible for a large increase in the Stratocaster's popularity, especially in his favorite finish, white. In reference to his famed on-stage Stratocaster burning, Hendrix is quoted as saying, "The time I burned my guitar it was like a sacrifice. You sacrifice the things you love. I love my guitar.In 1997 Fender produced a limited edition Hendrix tribute model Stratocaster.</p>
